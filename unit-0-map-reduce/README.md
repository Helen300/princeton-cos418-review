# Summary

**MapReduce** is a framework that offers an abstraction for large-scale computation by managing the scheduling, distribution, parallelism, partitioning, communication, and reliability. This is done by requiring applications to adhere to a template for execution.

Work flow:

0. Input split into `M` pieces
0. Assign `M` map tasks
0. Map tasks notify master of location for map-task output for each of the pre-sharded `R` reduce tasks generated by each map task
0. Master starts reducer with its `M` inputs when those are all ready (blocked execution)
0. Reducers do a group-by key on the entirety of their input.
0. Reducers apply their reduce function, output is stored to temp file.
0. The master is notified when a reducer is done by an atomic rename to a fixed file name.

Notes:

* Master SPOF
* Pre-emptive re-launch of tasks when slow or non-responsive. This is what requires blocked execution mentioned above for correctness. Similarly, the atomic rename is necessary for handling redundant reducers.
* `O(MR)` state on master.
* Output stored in `R` separate files.
